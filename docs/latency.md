# Latency Simulation 

In pySimX, latency is added at every step where the exchange interacts with the 'outside' world. The latency that is added can have different models. Currently, only two simple modules are implemented: 

1. Constant latency 
2. Log-normal latency. More information about this can be found in the examples [here](https://github.com/jaNGOB/pySimX/blob/main/pySimX/examples/Latency%20Estimation.ipynb)
